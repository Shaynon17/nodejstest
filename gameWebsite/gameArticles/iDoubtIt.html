    <strong>Players</strong><br> 2+ <br>
    <strong>Supplies</strong><br> 1 deck <br>
</p><br>

        <h3>Objective</h3> <br>
        <p>The object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards into the middle.</p><br>

        <h3>Deal</h3> <br>
        <p>Deal the entire deck of cards to each player, one card at a time. Some players may have more cards than others, this is
        ok. Players hold their cards in their hand. If you are playing with 2 players, take a small random amount of cards out
        of the deck.</p><br>

        <h3>Game Play</h3> <br>
        <p>The player left of the dealer goes first. The game begins with aces being played. The first player will state how many
        aces they are putting in the middle. The cards are placed face down in the middle without anyone seeing them. The cards
        played do not have to reflect the cards stated. Play moves clockwise with the card rank increasing by one each time. The
        second round will be 2s, the 3rd round will be 3s, all the way up to kings, then looping back to aces.
        <br><br>
        During the game, a player may announce “I doubt it” when they feel a player has bluffed. When “I doubt it” is announced,
        the previously played cards are shown. If the previously stated cards were stated correctly, the player who announces “i
        doubt it” picks up all of the cards in the middle. If the cards were incorrectly played, the player who bluffed picks up
        all the cards in the middle. Continue play after this is resolved.
</p><br>

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3> <br>
        <p>-You have to play at least one card per turn.<br><br>
        -You can play up to four cards per turn.<br><br>
        -Any player can announce “I doubt it.”<br><br>
        -If no player announces “I doubt it” play continues.<br><br>
</p><br>

        <h3>Winner</h3> <br>
        <p>The first player to play all of their cards in the middle is the winner.
