    <strong>Players</strong><br> 2-4, 6 <br>
    <strong>Supplies</strong><br> 1 deck <br>
</p><br>

        <h3>Objective</h3> <br>
        <p>The object of the game is to get each of your piles to have four matching cards in rank. Cards can be swapped from a
        pile with a card from the middle.</p><br>

        <h3>Deal</h3> <br>
        <p>The number of cards dealt depends on the number of players. In a two player game, each player is dealt 24 cards. In a
        three player game, each player is dealt 16 cards. In a four player game, each player is dealt 12 cards.
        <br><br>
        There will always be four cards left after a deal. These cards are placed face up in the middle of all players.
</p><br>

        <h3>Setup</h3> <br>
        <p>The players will put their cards into face down piles of four cards each.
</p><br>

        <h3>Game Play</h3> <br>
        <p>A countdown from three will start the game as players will play as fast as possible simultaneously without taking turns.
        <br><br>
        Players will pick up one of their piles to look at and make a swap with a middle card if wanted. When making a card
        swap, a card from a player’s hand must be laid down in the middle before taking a card.
        <br><br>
        Only one card can be swapped at a time. Players can move between piles in any order, and as fast as wanted, but only one
        pile can be in their hand at a time.
</p><br>

        <h3>Winner</h3> <br>
        <p>The game ends when a player has four of a kind in every pile and announces “James Bond.” The winner reveals all their
        piles to prove they have won. If they are correct, they win. If they are wrong, they lose and everyone else wins.</p><br>
