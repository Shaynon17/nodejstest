    <h3>Objective</h3> 
        <p>The object of the game is to collect all the cards.</p>
  
    <h3>Deal</h3> 
        <p>To deal, split the cards evenly amongst players, one at a time. Some players may have one more card than others, this is
        ok. Each player gathers their cards and keeps them facedown in a pile.</p>

    <h3>Game Play</h3> 
        <p>The player left of the dealer goes first. The player flips the top card of their stack into the middle. If the card is a
        numbered card (2-10), play continues clockwise to the next player.
        <br><br>
        Each player places one card face up in turn order, until a player places an ace or a face card. When this happens, the
        next person has to play an ace or a face card as well within a certain amount of cards played (during one turn)
        depending on the card played.<br><br>
        -If an Ace is played, the next player has four chances to play an ace or a face card.<br><br>
        -If a King is played, the next player has three chances to play an ace or a face card.<br><br>
        -If a Queen is played, the next player has two chances to play an ace or a face card.<br><br>
        -If a Jack is played, the next player has one chance to play an ace or a face card.<br><br>
        If a face card or an ace is played, play moves to the next player who has to play a face card or an ace in the allotted
        chances. If no face card or ace is played, the middle pile is taken by the last player to play a face card or an ace.
        The cards are added to the bottom of the player's card stack.</p>

    <h3>Winner</h3>  
       <p>Once a player has all the cards, they win.</p>
