        <h3>Objective</h3> 
        <p>The objective of the game is to pair up the cards in your hand, and avoid being the last player holding the odd queen.</p>

        <h3>Deal</h3> 
        <p>Remove 1 queen from the deck and place it out of the game. Deal one card at a time to each player until all cards are
        dealt. Some players may have one more card than others, this is ok.</p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3> 
        <p>Players look at their card and place any pairs face down in front of them. After all the players have removed their
        pairs, the game play begins.
        <br><br>
        The player left of the dealer starts the game by drawing a card from the player to their right. If the card drawn
        creates a pair, the matching cards are laid down. If the card drawn does not create a pair, the card stays in the
        player's hand. Play continues clockwise, with players continuing to draw from the person counterclockwise (to their
        right.)
        <br><br>
        A player is safe from becoming the old maid when either the player pairs all the cards in their hand, or the player lays
        down a pair and only has one card left. The player's last card is then drawn by the next player leaving them without
        cards.
</p>

        <h3>Loser</h3> 
        <p>The player left with the odd queen loses the game.
