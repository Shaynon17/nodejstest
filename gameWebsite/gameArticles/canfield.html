        <h3>Game Play</h3> 
        <p>There will be a total of four foundation piles, one in each suit. The first foundation pile was started during setup,
        the other three foundation piles can be started with the others cards from each suit that matches the rank of the card
        used to start the first foundation pile. Cards can only be added to the foundation pile that are of the same suit and
        sequencing up in rank by one. Ace's loop in this game. so they are considered above the king and below the two. In the
        four pile layout, you can put the bottom card of a pile on the top card of another pile as long as the bottom card is of
        an opposite color and one sequence less than the card you are putting it onto. All cards on top of the card you are
        moving go with it. When there is an empty space in the layout, you can use a card from the stockpile or the discard pile
        to fill it.
        <br><br>
        To draw from the deck, flip over the top three cards face up. You may only use the top card of the discard pile. If you
        use the top card, the card under it is now the top card. Continue to flip the top three cards of the draw pile until it
        is out, then flip the pile over and continue.
        
        Cards can be moved from the stockpile to the foundation piles or the layout. Cards can be moved from the top of the
        discard pile to the layout or the foundation piles.
</p>


        <h3>To Win</h3> 
        <p>If the player gets all cards into the foundation pile, they win. If the player has no more available moves, and the
        foundation piles do not have all of the cards, they lose.</p>
