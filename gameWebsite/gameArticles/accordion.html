    <h2>Accordion Tutorial</h2> 

<p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 1 |

</p>

    <h3>Objective</h3> 
    <p>The object of the game is to get all the cards in one pile.</p>
    <h3>Setup</h3> 
    <p>The player deals out the cards one by one face up, in a row from left to right, as many times as space allows. If you
    need to make multiple rows, you can, the first card on the second row is considered one space to the right of the last
    card on the first row. Rows continue to follow this pattern.</p>

    <!-- <h2>Card Rank</h2> 
    <p>x</p> -->
    <h3>Game Play</h3> 
    <p>Any card may be placed on top of the card to its left, or the third card to its left, as long as the cards are of the
    same suit or of the same rank. If a card qualifies for being moved, it is your choice whether or not you move it.
    
    When the movement of one or more cards have formed a pile, the entire pile is moved solely based on the top card of the
    pile, all cards underneath are ignored, but still moved with the top card.
