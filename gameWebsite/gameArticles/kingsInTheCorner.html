        <p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2-4
<strong>| Type:</strong> Patience 
            <strong>| Supplies:</strong> 1 deck, paper and pen |
        </p>

        <h3>Objective</h3> 
        <p>The object of the game is to be the first player to play all of their cards into the middle each round.</p>
        

        <h3>Deal</h3> 
        <p>Each player is dealt seven cards, one card at a time. The remaining deck is placed in the middle.</p>

        <h3>Setup</h3> 
        <p>A card is flipped face up on all four sides of the deck. If a king is flipped up, the king is moved to the
            corner of the
            deck. If this happens, flip over a card to replace the empty spot.</p>

        <h3>Card Rank</h3> 
        <p>King is high. Ace is low.</p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3> 
        <p>The player left of the dealer is first to play. Every turn begins with the player drawing a card from the
            center deck.
            Cards can be played on the face up cards in the middle.
            <br><br>
            Cards are played in decreasing sequence with the opposite color suit. For example, a black ace can be played
            on a red 2.
            Players may play as many cards as they want each turn. Players announce they are done to end their turn.
            Play continues
            clockwise.
            <br><br>
            The kings start a new pile off the corners of the middle deck. An entire pile can be moved when the bottom
            card of one
            pile is eligible to be played on the top card of another pile. They are eligible by being one rank away in
            an opposite
            color. The open space left by the move can be filled with any card from your hand. When a player gets rid of
            all of the
            cards in their hand, the round is over.
        </p>

        <h3>Scoring</h3> 
        <p>At the end of a round, players score ten points for each king left in their hand and one point for each other
            card still
            in their hand. The game can be played to any number of points. Play the first game to 25 points. When any
            player reaches
            25 points, the game is over. If you do not want to keep score, check out the variants.</p>

        <!-- <h3>Additional Rules</h3> 
        <p>x</p> -->

        <h3>Winner</h3> 
        <p>When any player reaches 25 points, the game is over. The player with the least amount of points at the end of
            the game
            is the winner.</p>

        <h3>Variants</h3> 
        <p>If you do not want to keep score, you can play to where the player who gets rid of all of their cards is the
            winner.
            When the score is not kept, kings are not allowed to stay in your hand. If you start with one in your
            starting hand, you
            must play it at the start of your turn. If you draw a king, you must play it immediately.</p>
