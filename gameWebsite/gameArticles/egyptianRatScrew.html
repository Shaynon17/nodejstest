<p class="type_players_supplies"><strong>| Players:</strong> 2+
<strong>| Type:</strong> War 
    <strong>| Supplies:</strong> 1 deck |
</p>
        <h3>Objective</h3> 
        <p>The object of the game is to collect all the cards.
        </p>

        <h3>Deal</h3> 
        <p>Deal out the entire deck, one card at a time, to each player. Some players may have one more card than
            others, this is
            ok. The cards are not looked at and remain face down in each player's hand in a card stack.</p>

        <h3>Game Play</h3> 
        <p>Game Play
            The player left of the dealer is first to play. The player flips the top card of their stack into the middle
            of everyone
            face up. If the card is a numbered card (2-10), play continues to the next player clockwise.
            <br><br>
            If the card played into the middle is a face card or an ace, the next player has to play a face card or an
            ace as well.
            Depending on the card played, the next player gets a number of changes to play a face card or ace. The
            number of chances
            are as followed:
            <br><br>
            Ace - four chances to play a face card or an ace
            King - three chances to play a face card or an ace
            Queen - two chances to play a face card or an ace
            Jack - one chance to play a face card or an ace
            <br><br>
            If a face card or ace is played within the allowed number of chances, that player stops playing cards and
            the next
            person has to play a face card or ace based on the most recent face card or ace played. This continues until
            no face
            card or ace is played. Once this happens, the middle pile is taken by the last person who played a face card
            or ace and
            is added to the bottom of the players card stack.
        </p>

        <h4>Slaps</h4> 
        <p>During game play, anytime the following card combinations are played into the middle, the pile can be
            slapped. And the pile of cards in the middle go at the bottom of the stack of the first player to slap them.
            Keep your hands on the
            pile until it is determined who won the pile.</p>
        
        <ul class="game_play_list">
            <li>-Doubles: If the two cards on the top of the pile have the same rank</li> 
            <li>-Sandwich: A double is on top with only one card between them. For example: the top card is a 7, the
                card under
                it is a 9, and the card under that one is a 7. The 7s being the double and the 9 being sandwiched in
                between.</li> 
            <li>-Top Bottom: If the top card of the pile matches the card at the bottom of the pile.</li> 
            <li>-Marriage: If a king and queen are played on top of each other. It does not matter which one is on top.
            </li>
        </ul> 

        <h3>Additional Rules</h3> 
        <p>-If a card is played on top of a combination that could have been slapped, the chance to slap that combination
            has passed and is no longer valid. <br><br>
            -If a player mistakenly slaps the pile, they must put a card from their stack to the bottom of the middle
            pile. <br><br>
            -When a player runs out of cards, they are not out of the game. They are still allowed to slap the pile to
            win cards.<br><br>
            -If a player mistakenly slaps the pile in the middle and they do not have any cards, they are out of the
            game.
        </p>

        <h3>Winner</h3> 
        <p>The player who collects all of the cards into their stack is the winner.
