        <h2>Tutorials</h2>
        <p>Here at Practical Gaming Center, you will find written tutorials on how to play a variety of card games. Other types of
        games like dice games, board games, and games that need no materials, will be added soon. I like to keep things simple.
        You will find concise rules to get started with a game, or for a refresher on how the game works if needed. These
        tutorials are for all levels of players. Browse the A-Z Tutorials to find your next game for game night. Can't find a
        game you are looking for? Look below to learn how to help this library grow.</p>
